\f0\fs24 \cf0 For my final project I plan to create an animation controlled by y-axis scroll behavior.\
\
I recently launched a new website for my startup Remesh. We left out this animation for the time being do to not wanting to take away from dev resources, but we all agree that the dynamic scroll-interactive prototype communicates better than the current static diagrams seen on the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://remesh.ai"}}{\fldrslt http://remesh.ai}} homepage today.\
_\
\
You can see my prototyped example movie file in this folder.\
\
For a real-world example, check out the archive of the x.ai How it Works page:\
